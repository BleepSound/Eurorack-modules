# Double MS20 VCF

2 filters in one with a possibility to bridge them and get a band pass filter.

When using the band pass mode, signal IN on filter 1 and out on filter 2.

For each filter :

- Ms20-VCF clone based on BartonSynth version.

- cutoff + resonance, with a switch to chose low pass or high pass mode.

- CV control on the filter cutoff.

- Self oscilation if resonance pushed to maximum, can be adjusted with 2 trimmers  on each filter.

    - 1 trimmer for the sine wave amplitude (resVol)
    - 1 trimmer for the level at which the knob for resonance starts the self oscillation (resLvl)

Uses an DIP LM13700 not produced anymore, Will do an SMD version soon.

Regular build, I use ceramic capacitors but you can use film/polyester.
