# MS20 VCF

Ms20-VCF clone based on BartonSynth version.

cutoff + resonance, with a switch to chose low pass or high pass mode.

CV control on the filter cutoff.

Self oscilation if resonance pushed to maximum, can be adjusted with 2 trimmers :

- 1 trimmer for the sine wave amplitude (resVol)
- 1 trimmer for the level at which the knob for resonance starts the self oscillation (resLvl)

Uses an SMD LM13700 because the DIP ones are not produced anymore.

Regular build, I use ceramic capacitors but you can use film/polyester.
